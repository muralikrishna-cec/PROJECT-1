## ✅ Your Learning Plan Breakdown

### 🟡 **1. JavaScript (Apna College 12-hour tutorial)**

🔗 [Apna College Full JS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdRvxDWH4w)

✔️ Covers everything from variables, functions, DOM, ES6+ features

> ✅ **Suggestion**:

* Don’t try to finish all 12 hrs in one go — split it like:

  * 6 hrs today (basics + DOM + functions)
  * 6 hrs tomorrow (arrays, objects, ES6, promises)

⏱ **Time estimate for today**: 6–7 hrs

---

### 🟢 **2. TypeScript (JVL Code – Crash Course)**

🔗 [JVL Code TypeScript Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtOgw9eOQoM)

> ✅ **Suggestion**:

* Once you complete JavaScript basics, TypeScript will make a lot of sense.
* Just focus on what makes TypeScript *different*:

  * Type system
  * Interfaces
  * Generics
  * Classes

⏱ **Time estimate**: 1.5–2 hrs

---

### 🔵 **3. Angular (JVL Code Angular Full Series)**

🔗 [JVL Code Angular Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgH5QX0i9K3oJ6c4FVd5JUy4Q0Up5Z5kY)

> ✅ **Suggestion**:

* Just watch 1–2 videos today — only intro + project setup.
* Full Angular can be learned **in parallel** while building your project.

⏱ **Today’s time**: \~1 hour for getting started

* OOP Concepts (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
* Exception handling

🎥 Suggested:

* [Apna College Java Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmnCZ7-9yDY) (Watch at 1.25x speed)

---

#### ✅ Day 2–3: Spring Boot Basics

> Learn how to build simple REST APIs using Spring Boot

🎥 Watch:

* [Amigoscode Spring Boot for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SGDpanrc8U) (Best for clean intro)
* [Love Babbar Spring Boot Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jR3x1PpJ_s) (Optional if you want Hindi)

✅ Topics to learn:

* What is Spring Boot
* Creating a REST API (GET, POST)
* Controller, Service, Repository layers
* `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, `@Service`, `@Repository`

---

#### ✅ Day 4: Connecting to MySQL / MongoDB

* Learn to save and fetch data from DB
* JPA (for MySQL) or MongoTemplate (for MongoDB)

🔧 Use:

* Spring Data JPA
* Basic `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`
* Repository Interface (CRUD)

---

#### ✅ Day 5: JWT Authentication
